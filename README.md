# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I learned about the following:

- Semantic HTML5 markup for structuring content.
- Utilizing CSS custom properties for consistent theming.
- Implementing Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout design.
- Adhering to a mobile-first workflow for responsiveness.

```html
<div class="qr-img-container">
  <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="qr-code" />
</div>
```

```css
.container {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
  background-color: rgb(162, 165, 219);
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

For future projects, I aim to continue focusing on:

- Enhancing my knowledge of CSS techniques and best practices.
- Exploring advanced layout design with CSS Grid and Flexbox.
- Improving my understanding of responsive design principles.
